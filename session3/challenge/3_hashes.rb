# Write a method that takes a string and returns a hash
# whose keys are all the downcased words in the string,
# and values are the number of times these words were seen.
#
# No punctuation will appear in the strings.
#
# Example:
# word_count "The dog and the cat" # => {"the" => 2, "dog" => 1, "and" => 1, "cat" => 1}

def word_count(str)
	hash = Hash.new { 0 }
	str.split(' ').each do |x|
		hash[x.downcase] += 1
	end
	hash
